# Collaborative-filtering research

A research has been conducted in which an overview of collaborative filtering recommender system and the major collaborative filtering challenges have been addressed.
   
The proposed approach significantly improves the recommendation quality
of collaborative filtering, and outperforms UPCC (user based), IPCC(item based) and EMDP. It can also be inferred that more accurate predictions are obtained with the larger numbers of training users and active usersâ€™ rated items.
   
 The solution provided in the given report was implemented and evaluated by predicting the ratings in the test set (test_ds).
- The report was thoroughly studied to understand the underlying idea of the proposed solution.
- The corresponding MAE and RMSE of your implementation were stored into the defined corresponding variable ME and RMSE.
  
  
From a business point of view, recommendation engines can significantly increase revenue and improve CTRs (click- through rate).
Recommendations can easily drive a notable amount of engagement from the users.
